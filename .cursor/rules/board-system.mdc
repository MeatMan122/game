# The primary goal of the BoardSystem is to manage state that will be shareable between players inbetween rounds - that is to say, if a game began with a particular populated BoardState (such as 2 groups of warriors on team A and 1 warrior 1 archer on team B, all with precise grid locations and unit specific stats or modifiers), then the exact game could be replicated. It is intended to be passed between game clients in order to maintain an accurate picture of the state of the board since the board will grow each round and needs to reset after battles.

- [BoardSystem.js](mdc:src/systems/BoardSystem.js) is the main file for all BoardSystem related code
- BoardSystem manages the serializable game state
- All CRUD operations related to the [BoardSystem.js](mdc:src/systems/BoardSystem.js) should live in the BoardSystem
- The BoardSystem is not intended for deriving unit positions or informing the battlefield beyond setup between rounds.
