# The GridSystem is intended for managing the grid, which includes drawing, deriving locations on the grid for units to interpret, etc.

- [GridSystem.js](mdc:src/systems/GridSystem.js) is where all GridSystem code should live
- GridSystem provides coordinate translation services
- All CRUD operations related to the GridSystem should live in [GridSystem.js](mdc:src/systems/GridSystem.js)
- Responsible for grid-related calculations and visual representation
- Provides coordinate translation services (world to grid, grid to world)
- No unit state should be managed in the GridSystem
- The GridSystem is the ultimate source of truth for finding positions on the grid, and is where many other objects, such as those in [Unit.js](mdc:src/units/Unit.js) will populate their initial positioning state.
